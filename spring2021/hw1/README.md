# Instructions for hw1

In this homework we will perform a video classification task using audio-only features.

## Data and Labels

Please download the videos from [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Oyzv7eC0QDrg0vX3AdSXYzdsFpIsdzT-/view?usp=sharing) or [this link](https://aladdin-eax.inf.cs.cmu.edu/shares/11775/homeworks/hw_11775_videos.zip). Then download the labels from [here](https://aladdin-eax.inf.cs.cmu.edu/shares/11775/homeworks/labels.zip).

## Step-by-step baseline instructions

For the baselines, we will provide code and instructions for two feature representations (MFCC-Bag-of-Features and [SoundNet-Global-Pool](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.09001.pdf)) and two classifiers (SVM and MLP). Assuming you are under Ubuntu 18.04 system and under this directory (11775-hws/spring2021/hw1/).

First, put the videos into `videos/` folder and the labels into `labels/` folder simply by:
```
$ unzip hw_11775_videos.zip
$ unzip labels.zip
```

### MFCC-Bag-Of-Features

Let's create the folders we need first:
```
$ mkdir audio/ mfcc/ bof/
```

1. Dependencies: FFMPEG, OpenSMILE, Python: sklearn, pandas

Download OpenSMILE 2.3.0 from [here](https://he.audeering.com/download/opensmile-2-3-0-tar-gz/) and then extract in this directory:
```
$ tar -zxvf opensmile-2.3.0.tar.gz
```

Install FFMPEG by:
```
$ sudo apt install ffmpeg
```

Install python dependencies by:
```
$ sudo pip2 install sklearn pandas tqdm
```

2. Get MFCCs

We will first extract wave files and then run OpenSMILE to get MFCCs into CSV files. We will directly run the binaries of OpenSMILE (no need to install):
```
$ for file in videos/*;do filename=$(basename $file .mp4); ffmpeg -y -i $file -ac 1 -f wav audio/${filename}.wav; ./opensmile-2.3.0/bin/linux_x64_standalone_static/SMILExtract -C config/MFCC12_0_D_A.conf -I audio/${filename}.wav -O mfcc/${filename}.mfcc.csv;done
```
The above should take 1-2 hours.

Note that some audio/mfcc files might be missing. This is due to the fact that some videos have no audio, which is common in real-world scenario. We'll learn to deal with that.

3. K-Means clustering

As taught in the class, we will use K-Means to get feature codebook from the MFCCs. Since there are too many feature lines, we will randomly select a subset (20%) for K-Means clustering by:
```
$ python2 select_frames.py labels/trainval.csv 0.2 selected.mfcc.csv --mfcc_path mfcc/
```

Now we train it by (50 clusters, this would take about 7-15 minutes):
```
$ python2 train_kmeans.py selected.mfcc.csv 50 kmeans.50.model
```

4. Feature extraction

Now we have the codebook, we will get bag-of-features (a.k.a. bag-of-words) using the codebook and the MFCCs. First, we need to get video names:
```
$ ls videos/|while read line;do filename=$(basename $line .mp4);echo $filename;done > videos.name.lst
```


Now we extract the feature representations for each video:
```
$ python2 get_bof.py kmeans.50.model 50 videos.name.lst --mfcc_path mfcc/ --output_path bof/
```

Now you can follow [here](#svm-classifier) to train SVM classifiers or [MLP](#mlp-classifier) ones.

### SoundNet-Global-Pool

Just as the MFCC-Bag-Of-Feature, we could also use the [SoundNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.09001.pdf) model to extract a vector feature representation for each video. Since SoundNet is trained on a large dataset, this feature is usually better compared to MFCCs.

Please follow this Github repo to extract audio features. Please read the paper and think about what layer(s) to use. If you save the feature representations in the same format as in the `bof/` folder, you can directly train SVM and MLP using the following instructions.

### SVM classifier

From the previous sections, we have extracted two fixed-length vector feature representations for each video. We will use them separately to train classifiers.

Suppose you are under `hw1` directory. Train SVM by:
```
$ mkdir models/
$ python2 train_svm_multiclass.py bof/ 50 labels/trainval.csv models/mfcc-50.svm.multiclass.model
```

Run SVM on the test set:
```
$ python2 test_svm_multiclass.py models/mfcc-50.svm.multiclass.model bof/ 50 labels/test_for_student.label mfcc-50.svm.multiclass.csv
```

For soundNet features:
```
$ python2 train_svm_multiclass.py soundnet_fea14_avg/ 128 labels/trainval.csv models/soundnet-conv4.svm.multiclass.model
$ python2 test_svm_multiclass.py models/soundnet-conv4.svm.multiclass.model soundnet_fea14_avg/ 128 labels/test_for_student.label soundnet-conv4.svm.multiclass.csv
```

### MLP classifier

Suppose you are under `hw1` directory. Train MLP by:
```
$ python2 train_mlp.py bof/ 50 labels/trainval.csv models/mfcc-50.mlp.model
```

Test:
```
$ python2 test_mlp.py models/mfcc-50.mlp.model bof 50 labels/test_for_student.label mfcc-50.mlp.csv
```

For soundNet features:
```
$ python2 train_mlp.py soundnet_fea14_avg/ 128 labels/trainval.csv models/soundnet-conv4.mlp.model
$ python2 test_mlp.py models/soundnet-conv4.mlp.model soundnet_fea14_avg 128 labels/test_for_student.label soundnet-conv4.mlp.csv
```

### Submission to Kaggle

You can then submit the test outputs to the leaderboard:
```
https://www.kaggle.com/c/11775-hw1
```
We use accuracy as the evaluation metric. Please refer to `hw1_sample_submission.csv` for submission format.

### Things to try to improve your model performance

Now here comes the fun part. You can start experimenting with the code and exploring how you can improve your model performance. Some hints:

+ Split `trainval.csv` into `train.csv` and `val.csv` to validate your model variants. This is important since the leaderboard limits the number of times you can submit, which means you cannot test most of your experiments on the official test set.
+ Try different number of K-Means clusters
+ Try different layers of SoundNet
+ Try different classifiers (different SVM kernels, different MLP hidden sizes, etc.). Please refer to [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neural_network.MLPClassifier.html#sklearn.neural_network.MLPClassifier) documentation.
